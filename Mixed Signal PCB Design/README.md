STM32 Mixed-Signal Audio Analysis & Generation Board

This project is a USB-powered STM32-based mixed-signal PCB capable of low-frequency signal analysis and arbitrary waveform generation in the audio band (20Hz–20kHz). It integrates both ADC and DAC with optimized analog front-ends, and is tailored for audio, instrumentation, and embedded testing applications.
