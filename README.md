# Embedded Hardware Projects Repository

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of **basic embedded hardware projects** designed for **learning and skill enhancement** in **schematic design, PCB layout, and embedded systems development**. Each project in this repository is aimed at improving my understanding of **electronics design principles, hardware debugging, firmware development, and best practices in PCB design**.

## Purpose & Goals

The main objectives of this repository include:

- **Developing hands-on experience** in **embedded hardware design**.
  
- **Practicing schematic and PCB layout techniques** using **KiCad**.

- **Exploring various microcontrollers** (STM32, AVR, PIC, ESP, etc.).

  
- **Enhancing firmware development skills** in **C/C++**.


- **Understanding design rules and industry best practices**.


- **Testing and validating hardware prototypes**.


## Key Learning Areas

Projects in this repository will cover:

- **Microcontroller-based designs** (STM32, ESP32, etc.).

  
- **Power management & circuit protection**.
  
- **Analog & digital signal processing**.
  
- **Wireless communication (BLE, Wi-Fi, LoRa, etc.)**.
  
- **Interfacing sensors, displays, and peripherals**.
  
- **Debugging and firmware development**.
  

## Contribution & Future Expansion

As I progress in my embedded systems journey, I plan to:

- **Expand the repository with more complex designs**.
  
- **Optimize PCB layouts for better efficiency and manufacturability**.
  
- **Integrate more advanced concepts such as AI on embedded systems**.
  
- **Document learnings and challenges encountered during development**.
  

**Follow my journey in embedded systems and hardware design!**
