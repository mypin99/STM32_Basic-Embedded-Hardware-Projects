Embedded Systems Roadmap – Project Repository

Welcome to my Embedded Systems Roadmap Repository, where I document, design, and share the hardware projects I’ve built as part of my journey into embedded systems, PCB design, and hardware interfacing.

This repository is a living collection of real-world, hands-on projects that cover topics such as:

USB communication

Microcontroller interfacing

Power management

Sensor integration

Industrial I/O

ESD protection and hardware reliability

What You'll Find Here

Each subfolder in this repository is a complete design project containing:

✅ Schematics (KiCad)

✅ PCB Layout (KiCad)

✅ Rendered images

✅ PDFs (schematics, layout, etc.)

✅ README (project-specific)

✅ Firmware (if applicable)


🎯 Goals of This Repository

Document my hardware learning path

Build a strong foundation in PCB design (KiCad)

Interface real-world hardware with embedded systems

Experiment with microcontrollers, sensors, and protocols

Learn proper ESD, power, and signal design practices

Share reusable open-source designs with the community

Tools and Skills Used

KiCad (schematics and layout)

STM32 / ESP32 / Arduino

C / C++ firmware development

PCB fabrication workflows

Soldering and testing

Git + GitHub for version control

About Me
I'm an electrical and embedded systems engineer passionate about hardware-software co-design, automation, and reliable system architecture. This repository reflects my continuous learning journey through practical experimentation and real-world builds.
