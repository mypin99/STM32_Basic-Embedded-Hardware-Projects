USB to UART Bridge Converter â€“ Enhanced with ESD Protection
Overview
This project is a custom-designed USB to UART bridge converter based on the CP2102 chip. It improves upon common commercial modules by incorporating robust ESD protection on all critical lines (RX, TX, VBUS, and USB differential pairs), increasing device longevity and overall reliability.

The converter is ideal for embedded systems, development boards, or any USB-to-serial communication applications that require stability, USB compatibility, and protection from electrostatic damage.

Applications
Microcontroller communication via USB

Firmware uploading and serial monitoring

Debugging embedded systems

Safe serial communication in electrostatic environments

Getting Started
Connect the USB to your PC
Drivers are usually installed automatically. If not, download them from Silicon Labs.

Use a terminal program (e.g., TeraTerm, PuTTY, minicom)
Connect to the assigned COM port with appropriate baud rate and settings.

Connect RX/TX
Wire the RX pin of this module to the TX pin of your device and vice versa.

Power Your Circuit

Use the 5V pin to power 5V devices directly from USB

Use the 3.3V pin to power lower voltage circuits (max ~100mA)
